Page is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) and created by Jekyll. It uses [Midnight](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight) theme.

It's my third or fourth attempt to create personal blog about. This time I have a plan... smart plan what I want to publish here and how.

Temporary it's on github pages, later maybe I'll move it somewhere elese with better domain. Still title of this page and final domain needs to be choosen.

- For sure here I'll post lots of code snipepts and thoughs about ham radio, PZK (Polish National Amateur Radio Assotiation).
