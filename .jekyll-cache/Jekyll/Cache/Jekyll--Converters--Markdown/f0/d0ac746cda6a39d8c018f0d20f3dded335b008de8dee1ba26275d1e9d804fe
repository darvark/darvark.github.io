I"Ô<p><strong>Hi Iâ€™m Marcin, and welcome on my small page.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™ll post here mostly stuff about ham radio (amateur radio) and my IT projects, that are in most cases connected to Python and DevOps stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m licensed amateur radio operator since 2016 and Iâ€™m leading small Ham Radio Club since 2018.
My equipment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kenwood TS-870S</li>
  <li>Anytone AT-778UV</li>
  <li>Yaesu FT-4XE</li>
  <li>Horizontal Delta loop antenna (desing by SP7LA)</li>
  <li>Diamond X200N</li>
  <li>Diamond GSV3000</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m working mostly on SSB, and still learning CW - I completed Basic, Beginner and Intermediate level of CWOps Academy</p>

<p>You can find me on band during many contests, sometimes using my own call sign <strong>SP6MI</strong>, sometimes as a member of club representation <strong>SN6E</strong></p>

<p>Since most of my career I worked as an Devops engineer I love scripting languages. My favorites are <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Bash</strong>. At least those were/are most popular in my projects.</p>

<p>Currently Iâ€™m digging into <strong>Anisble</strong> and <strong>Terraform</strong> which seems to be great tools.</p>

<hr />

<p>On my Github page you can find my own (not finished yet) implementation of Hamradio contesting software. Itâ€™s as simple as can be, but still some of functionalities are not finished. It has been written in <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>QT5</strong> framework.</p>
